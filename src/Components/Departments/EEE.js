                      About E.E.E. Department
                  </h3>
Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering has started functioning from the year 1959 since the inception of the S.V. University College of Engineering and pioneered itself in catering the needs of the students, industry and society.<br/>
The department is offering one Under Graduation course B.Tech (EEE) and one Post Graduation course (Power systems). Both UG and PG programs have been accredited by NBA, New Delhi.<br/>
The department offers Ph.D program (Part-time & Full –time) in wide range of research areas like Renewable Energy Sources, Power Quality, Reactive Power and Control Management, Electrical Distribution Systems, Electrical Vehicles etc. So far more than 100 Ph.D degrees have been awarded and 30 are in pipeline.<br/>
The annual intake is 72 in UG program and 18 in PG program.<br/>
Based on AICTE/APSCHE guidelines, the department is regularly updating the curriculum to meet the industrial, academic and societal needs.<br/>
The Department has 4 Professors, 2 Assistant professors, 9 Academic Consultants and 9 supporting staff. To meet the academic & research requirements the department has developed 9 laboratories which are regularly maintained and the equipment updated. With the financial support from TEQIP the department and lab facilities have been improved.<br/>
All the faculty members are committed to teaching and research. Students of UG and PG are encouraged to take up high quality projects with in the college and in industries as well. Most of the UG students get selected in campus placements while some of them opt for higher studies. Good number of students have got placed in Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) through GATE exam. Co-curricular and extracurricular activities are regularly conducted to impart life skills amongst the students and make them feel responsible towards the society and country.<br/>
The department has active and strong Alumni who are occupying top positions like CEO, EE, GM etc. in highly reputed organizations in India and abroad. They provide financial support to improve the various facilities in the department and college.<br/>
