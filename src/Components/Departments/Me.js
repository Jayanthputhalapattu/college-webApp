                      About Mechanical Engineering Department
                  </h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME) was started in the year 1959. This department is offering B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and two M.Tech programs: Industrial Engineering and Production Engineering. Several Research scholars are pursuing Ph.Ds in all the classical areas of Mechanical Engineering and upcoming areas too. So far around 70 Ph.Ds have been awarded. The faculty members have published about 450 technical papers in different journals and conferences. The academic activities are supported by 14 laboratories and are refurbished with TEQIP funds. The department is focusing major research in the areas of welding, vibration, tribology, metal cutting, composite materials, solar energy, lean manufacturing, CAPP, Supply chains, Quality control, etc. and also department of mechanical engineering is revising the courses in every two years to meet the industrial requirement. As a consequence every year majority of students from mechanical engineering department are placed in different industries and getting admission in reputed organizations in and aboard.</p>.<br/>
